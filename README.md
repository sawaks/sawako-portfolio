This project is proof of understanding module1 and 2. Through week 2, I learned to advanced CSS.

## My Task

As a candidate to apply for the position of a web developer, this website needs to let people know I have some knowledge and skill to be able to be a web developer. Using advanced CSS and HTML which people can understand, I should code the profile website.

## Main particular points

- index.HTML
  Making up HTML with syntax consciously.
- CSS
  * Easy to change some designs with valuable selectors in the future.
  * Using responsive design (for a tablet and a moba), make the website with more user ability.
  * Making a hamburger menu, consider coding with advanced CSS including pseudo-elements.
